# interactive-dashboard-challenge
This challenge provided starter code for HTML. The challenge was to create an interactive dashboard for the bellybutton contents of more than 150 subjects. A panel shows the demographic information of the subject and two separate graphs highlight the different contents of their belly buttons.

The project limited us to using JavaScript, HTML, and D3.js.
